## Running Tests and Setup Instructions

*Cypress (if not installed)
If Cypress is not currently installed in your project, you can install it as a dev dependency using npm:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

*Opening Cypress
To open Cypress for running tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

*Frontend Setup
If you haven't cloned the frontend repository yet, you can do so by copying the repository path and running:

```bash
git clone <repository_path>
```

*Navigate to the cloned folder:

```bash
cd <folder_name>
```

*Install dependencies if they are not installed:

```bash
npm install
```

*Running the Frontend
To run the frontend and open it in your browser locally, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*If Cypress has been opened at least once, you can directly open it by navigating to the project folder and running:

```bash
cd <folder_name>
```
```bash
npx cypress open
```

Remember to start the frontend server if you want to open it in localhost using npm run dev. If you don't want to use localhost, you can deploy it to your preferred hosting service like Netlify.

That's it! You're all set to run tests with Cypress and work with the frontend.
